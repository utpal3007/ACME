The `azurerm_app_service_plan` resource has been superseded by the `azurerm_service_plan` resource. Whilst this resource will continue to be available in the 2.x and 3.x releases it is feature-frozen for
compatibility purposes, will no longer receive any updates and will be removed in a future major release of the Azure Provider.

guarantee to take exactly these actions if you run "terraform apply" now.
